# Project 1â€“2 Phase 2

## Description
In this project,
the goal was to familiarize ourselves with numerical approximation methods for Ordinary Differential Equations.
Those equations were used to simulate a game called "Crazy Putting," which gave us the following tasks:
1. Solver to simulate the game.
2. GUI to graphically represent the game.
3. Bot, that plays the game automatically.

This presented us with many challenges, however, you can read about those in our report.

## How to use:

Make sure maven is installed and do a clean compile of the project to make sure all components are working. 
After that use the main class located in `main class location` to run the project.
